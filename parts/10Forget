on huge databases most dangerous are DROP TABLE, ALTER TABLE. it may result in very dead end
always use more valid strategies like (CREATE TABLE A_NEW LIKE A),
optimize new A_NEW. make full structure required by foreign keys like B_new
optimize tables. import data from existing with small limits during huge time period.
launch table renaming A >> A_OLD with all required others, A_NEW >> A
could also continue migrating records for some time to inherit all data.

but again better to just grow structure of tables. As prev approach
will have problematic gap during renaming you will have magic data losses that needs to be handled
or stop production server for final sync and renaming table time (5-10 seconds + app boot usually long)
