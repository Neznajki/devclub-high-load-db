I selected MySQL DB only as I have most experience there mainly all SQL are more or less same so you can pick patterns from one to another.
difference is syntax or some key features.

Usually primary take away and what you should understand picking technology is how DB stores the data I will explain on MySQL example

1. you describe fields (each field have type and limits on containing value)
2. Each row reserves maximum field size on HDD even if they are null (to jump between limits based on pure math)
3. Text Fields are storing Pointer to data that besides out of table (it is optimal but will slow down on filtering texts)
4. Indexes takes time to save and can flood your cache (it may result as deadlocks)
5. Indexes should be sorted.
6. Data is pure math the more Bytes it takes the more time it makes for all operations
