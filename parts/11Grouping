There are tons of grouping functions like, AI may help with finding right approaches for your case

With
Union
GROUP BY
Distinct

key takeaway from me would be that You should use them rarely better to use DISTINCT, MAX, ... and things like that
if they are not suiting your need than go to GROUP BY. never use GROUP_CONCAT and things like that.
You will ask why ? it's easy on huge datasets they will provide wrong info (You can't really rely on them)
There are tons of options how you can utilize GROUP BY but usually it ends up with CREATE Temp table deadlocks.
huge dataset index locks, complex scenarios where all PKs are blocked due to grouping logic that tries to allocate memory for TMP table

Also use record result limiting always. even if you have no grouping, and pick good size of result sets.
in low datasets you will be okay when you are limiting 100 records as you will have 50, in huge it will save your ass right away
also there are Pagination and things like that won't work with GROUPING logic this may lead to full table scan.
