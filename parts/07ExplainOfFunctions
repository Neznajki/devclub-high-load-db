SQL usually have multiple ways to debug the application I may not name all but I will touch best ones (IMHO).

1. Explain (Query here)
2. SHOW PROCESSLIST.
3. slow_query_log = 1 // best to log all queries (5-10 minutes) than group analyze total execution time
4. KILL PROCESSID (to identify deadlock parent usually oldest one but not always.)
5. Usually low resources can lead to deadlocks (waiting for cache to get free. so resource analyze like top can be good also)
